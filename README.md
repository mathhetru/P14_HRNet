> 14th project of Front-end Web Developper training by OpenClassrooms "Switch a jQuery library to React"

This codebase contains the code needed to run the backend and the frontend for HRNet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

HRNet uses the following tech stack:

- [Node.js v12](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React + Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)

Please make sure you have the right versions and download both packages. You can verify this by using the following commands in your terminal:

````bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

### Instructions

1. Clone the repo onto your computer
2. Open a terminal window in the cloned project
3. Run the following commands:

## Frontend

```bash
# Go to the back repository
cd front/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev
````

Your front server should now be running at http://localhost:5173/!
